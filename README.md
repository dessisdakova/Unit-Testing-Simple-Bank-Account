# Simple Bank Account Unit Testing in C#

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates unit testing for a simple Bank Account class in C#. The class simulates basic banking operations such as creating an account, depositing, and withdrawing money, with unit tests to validate different scenarios.
## Features
- Create a bank account with an initial balance. <br />
- Deposit money into the account, with validation for positive amounts.<br />
- Withdraw money from the account, including checks for negative amounts and overdrafts.<br />

## Tech Stack
*Language:* C#<br />
*Testing Framework:*  NUnit<br />
*IDE:* Visual Studio<br />

## How It Works
The Bank Account class allows basic operations such as adding and withdrawing money. Each method has been unit tested to ensure proper functionality and error handling.<br />
Key Methods in BankAccount Class:<br />
- ```BankAccount (double amount)```: Constructor for creating account<br />
- ```Deposit (double amount)```: Adds money to the account if the amount is positive.<br />
- ```Withdraw (double amount)```: Removes money from the account, ensuring the amount is valid and doesnâ€™t exceed the current balance.<br />


## Test Cases<br />
```Account Creation```: Asserts that a new bank account can be created with a valid initial balance.<br />
```Positive Deposit```: Tests depositing a positive amount.<br />
```Negative Deposit```: Ensures the system rejects negative deposits.<br />
```Valid Withdrawal```: Tests withdrawing an amount that is less than to the account balance.<br />
```Negative Withdrawal```: Ensures that attempting to withdraw a negative amount raises an error.<br />
```Exceeding Withdrawal```: Ensures that attempting to withdraw more than the available balance raises an error.
